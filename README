This is currently limited to IPv6 only.

Requires the perl modules Socket6, IO::Socket::INET6, and Time::HiRes

TODO:
 * Currently setup assuming request latency is less variable than response latency, make this configurable.  This would mean swapping the percentile filters
 * Automatically detecting/calculating max_rtt would be nice
 * Figure out a way to deal with static shifts in latency that would come from route changes (perhaps by monitoring min_rtt)
 * Evaluate using response latency + rtt-based scaling as a second data point
